Grades 6-12. I adhere to Virginia Department of Education's Computer Science and Digital Learning standards to provide a rounded offering. I utilize internationally recognized resources along with my own curriculum, while carefully assessing students' skills, weaknesses, and interests to tailor my lessons to their specific needs. I encourage parents and students to work with me in defining individual goals.  
I can be reached at heidi.edu@negrete.dev and am happy to answer questions!

## Rates and Scheduling

My rate is $40/hour. Students must schedule a minimum of 1hr/week with me and plan to spend the same amount of time on homework. Sessions can be rescheduled the day-of, if I am contacted before 8:30am.

## Supplies

Laptop, headphones, and mouse. For local students, these will be provided, however, if the student wishes to bring their own they may. All electronics/robotics/other supplies will be provided to local students only. If you have a kit or robot of some kind already that you are hoping to get some help with, I'm happy to discuss that!

## Location

I teach locally in Front Royal, Virginia. Contact me for more details or remote options.
