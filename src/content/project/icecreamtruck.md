The game can be played with keyboard and mouse, however, if you would like to build your own controller it is a great beginner electronic project! Information about the controller and how to build, including the sketch and eletrical diagram can be found on my [github](https://github.com/Heidi-Negrete/arduino-controller-arlan).

## Devlog

I will be updating this section shortly thanks for your patience!
