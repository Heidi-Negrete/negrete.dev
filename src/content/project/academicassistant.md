I made this as the capstone project for my Software Engineering degree at WGU.

It is built in C# using the .NET MAUI framework. The project is set up to implement the MVVM (Models, View, View-Models) design pattern.

I particularly enjoyed setting up GitHub actions and the deployment script to automatically build and publish the artifact to GitHub pages.
